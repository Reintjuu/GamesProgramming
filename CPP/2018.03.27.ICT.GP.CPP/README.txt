In this .rar-file you find a folder named '2018.03.27.ICT.GP.CPP'. This has a Visual 
Studio solution. If you are going to use Visual Studio, please use this. If you are 
going to use something other then Visual Studio, you can use the separate main-files 
(one for each exercise) to still have all the same test code.
